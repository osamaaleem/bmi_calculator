# bmi_calculator

Building Flutter UI for Intermediates.

## Goal
The objective of this project is to look at how one can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve one's own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter.

## Output
I'm going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by Ruben Vaalt. It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
